These are just a few basic CAD assignments I have worked on during my time at McMaster Engineering.
These assigments were all made on Autodesk Inventor 2023 and have made me familiar and comfortable with various Inventor features.

The folder "medical container" is an individual design project and is completely original (Not based on a provided drawing).
